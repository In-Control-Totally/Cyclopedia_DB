# Cyclopedia DB
Contains a dockerfile to buld the image and a bash script for faster rebuilds

## How to run this Locally
1. Download and install [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
2. Clone the repository.  I recommend making a fork first, then any changes that you make can be managed via a pull request
3. Run the Cyclopedia.sql to create the DB instance

## Making updates
Commit to your fork of the repository and create a pull request describing the changes

## Other files
The Dockerfile and rebuild_db are there to facilitate the deployment on the remote server.  Grab me on Discord/Teams/Email if you need some help using these
